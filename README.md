# CryptoClustering

# Description
This project develops an unsupervised machine learning model using Python and associate libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. Initially the data is graphed using K-means, then trimmed using PCA and graphed again. See results below for detailed outcomes.

# Index
Under "Resources" there is a csv files storing all of the small-scale crypto market data (42 rows total). The 
"Starter Code" file contains a jupyter notebook with the step by step analysis and progressive visualizations.

# Results
The elbow curve or the scaled data and PCA data concluded that 4 is the best value for the KMean clustering. The explained variance of the model is 0.895, which is high for this particular data category. Composite graphs from both standardization processes are shown in the last five cells of the notebook.

# Credits
Some cells were reviewed for efficiency and professionalism by my mentor Justin Moore. No direct commits were necessary in the repository for the minimal collaboration.
